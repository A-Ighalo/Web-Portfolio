                <P>I am a Computer Science student at Algoma University
                    with a passion for data engineering and design.
                    Recently, I completed an 8-month long internship at TD Bank,
                    where I was part of the Fraud Prevention team.
                    This experience allowed me to apply my technical skills in a real-world
                    context and contribute to important security initiatives.
                    As an avid learner, I am always seeking new opportunities to grow and make a difference
                    in the field of technology.</P>
